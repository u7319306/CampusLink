# INFS3059 Major Project - CampusLink

## Description
CampusLink is a centralized and integrated student directory made for students by students. The purpose of this directory is to combine all of ANU's resources into one place for easy navigation and convenience. 
The directory also provides other helpful resources for students such as job information and assessment support. The idea is not to copy ANU's existing directories, but to offer one that is tailored more towards students, including international students.
