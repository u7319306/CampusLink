       Job Classifications
  =============================== -->
<div class =job-types>
  <h2>Job Classifications</h2>
  <div class="box1">
    <h3>Casual</h3>
    <p>A casual job is a temporary, "as-needed" employment arrangement where the employee is not guaranteed consistent hours and receives no firm advance commitment to ongoing work. Key characteristics include variable hours from week to week, no guaranteed pay, and often a higher hourly rate (casual loading) in lieu of benefits like paid leave. The employee's roster is determined by the employer's needs, and they typically have the flexibility to accept or refuse shifts. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="box2">
    <h3>Part-Time</h3>
    <p>A part-time job is employment for less than the standard full-time hours in a week, typically resulting in regular, scheduled work hours and a pro-rata salary, unlike a casual role. These roles can be permanent or on fixed-term contracts and offer greater flexibility than full-time work, although potentially with fewer benefits and less job security. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="box3">
    <h3>Full-Time</h3>
    <p>A full-time job is a permanent or fixed-term position requiring the employee to work a standard number of hours per week, which is typically 38 hours in Australia but can vary by award or agreement, to receive full workplace entitlements and benefits. These benefits often include paid leave (sick, annual), greater job security, and potentially higher salaries compared to part-time or casual roles.</p>
